This diagram illustrates how in an approximate search for a query vector vq​, the search algorithm identifies the nearest i centroids, where i defaults to the square root of k but can be adjusted for a specific query by setting the NEIGHBOR PROBES parameter. This adjustment allows for a trade-off between search speed and accuracy.
