This image illustrates a potential RAG workflow including the following five primary
            steps:

1. A user interface, usually in the form of a ChatBot, enables a dialog with an
               LLM.
2. To improve the quality of the answers, search your private business data for the
               most relevant facts to pass to the LLM.
3. Format the similarity search results as a prompt and context for the LLM.
4. Using up to date facts as input to LLMs minimizes the probability of the LLM
               hallucinating.
5. The high quality responses are returned to the ChatBot.
