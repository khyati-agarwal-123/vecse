The image shows a vector data set with a set of vectors where each vector is
            indicated by black X letters (or crosses) in the vector space. There is a red X in the
            center of the image, which represents the query vector, and a pale blue field around the
            red X vector that contains the five most similar vectors. All other vectors in the
            vector space are excluded.
