The image shows a comparison of the vectors returned both with an exact search,
            designated by their appearing in a pale blue field, and the
            vectors returned by a similarity search, which includes both the
            set of vectors in the pale blue field and a vector that was
            returned in the similarity search that was not returned in the
            exact search. The difference between the exact search result and
            the similarity search result is one vector. This means that,
            compared to the exact search, the similarity search retrieved 4
            out of 5 vectors correctly. The similarity search has 80%
            accuracy compared to the exact similarity search.
