This diagram shows that first the keyword search doc IDs and vector search chunk IDs and doc IDs are submitted to a RIGHT OUTER JOIN operation. Then the possible SEARCH_FUSION operators are shown, such as Union (which combines both the results), Intersect (which combines the common results), Minus_Text
            (which includes all vector results minus text results from the vector-text search).
