The image shows a vector data set with a set of vectors where each vector is
            indicated by black X letters (or crosses) in the vector space.
            There is a red X in the center of the image, which represents
            the query vector, and the query is a top-5 approximate
            similarity search. There is an orange field within which there
            are a set of five other vectors, in addition to the red X in the
            center, indicating that the approximate similarity search is
            returning these additional vectors, as well as the one that are
            returned in an exact search, but it also excludes the set of
            vectors outside of the orange field.
