This diagram illustrates how in an approximate search for a query vector vq​, once the i partitions are determined, they are fully scanned to identify, in this example, the top 5 nearest vectors. This number 5
            can be different from k and you specify this number in your query. The five nearest vectors to vq found in partitions number 1 and 3 are highlighted in this diagram.
