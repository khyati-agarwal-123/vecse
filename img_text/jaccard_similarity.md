This image depicts the Jaccard similarity using two BINARY
            vectors A and B where the similarity is calculated using the number of coordinates where
            at least one of the corresponding attributes is equal to 1. The formula to calculate the
            Jaccard similarity is ||A ∩ B|| / ||A ∪ B||. In this example, the
            Jaccard similarity is equal to 0.33, meaning the two binary vectors share 33% of the
            significant (non-zero) elements. The Jaccard distance is then calculated by subtracting
            the calculated similarity from 1, in this case, 1 - 0.33 = 0.67.
