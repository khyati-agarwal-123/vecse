This graph illustrates a Hierarchical Navigable Small World Index. Given a query vector, the search algorithm starts at a
            predefined vector in the graph. This entry point connects to several nearby vectors. The algorithm identifies which of them
            is the closest to the query vector and moves to that vector.
