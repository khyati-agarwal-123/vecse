This diagram shows a utility chain for a file-to-text-to-chunks-to-embeddings transformation. It is shown that first a PDF
            file is transformed into a text file (using the UTL_TO_TEXT function), then the resulting Text is transformed into Chunks (using the UTL_TO_CHUNKS function), and then the Chunks are transformed into Embeddings (using the UTL_TO_EMBEDDINGS function).
