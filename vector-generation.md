## About Vector Generation {#GUID-67DF6ACA-8C96-4D92-A927-A8EDCE24E853}

Learn about *Vector Utility SQL functions* and *Vector Utility PL/SQL packages* that help you transform unstructured data into vector embeddings. 

  * [Understand the Stages of Data Transformations](understand-stages-data-transformations.md)  
Your input data may travel through different stages before turning into a vector. 
  * [About SQL Functions to Generate Embeddings](sql-functions-generate-embeddings.md)  
Choose to implement Vector Utility SQL functions to perform parallel or on-the-fly chunking and embedding operations, within the database. The supplied SQL functions for vector generation are `VECTOR_CHUNKS` and `VECTOR_EMBEDDING`. 
  * [About PL/SQL Packages to Generate Embeddings](pl-sql-packages-generate-embeddings.md)  
Choose to implement Vector Utility PL/SQL packages to perform chunking, embedding, and text generation operations along with text processing and similarity search, both within and outside the database. You can schedule these operations as end-to-end pipelines. The supplied PL/SQL packages for vector generation are `DBMS_VECTOR` and `DBMS_VECTOR_CHAIN`.
