## Oracle AI Vector Search Integration with LangChain {#GUID-6F5D9515-CF59-4D2E-8854-138DB68D021C}

LangChain is a powerful and flexible open source orchestration framework that helps developers build applications that leverage the advanced capabilities of large language models (LLMs).

LangChain provides essential tools for managing workflows, maintaining context, and integrating with external systems. For example, the LangChain framework allows you to create Chatbots and agent applications. LangChain primarily supports Python but also has support for JavaScript and TypeScript.

Oracle AI Vector Search integrates with LangChain at various levels:

  * Document Loaders
  * Text Splitter
  * Embeddings
  * Summary
  * Vector Store



For more information about each of these components, see [LangChain Oracle AI Vector Search documentation](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/providers/oracleai/).
