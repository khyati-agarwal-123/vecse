## 8Query Data With Similarity and Hybrid Searches {#GUID-1085EF0C-D1CA-423F-A6F2-54A9E76BAAA5}

Use Oracle AI Vector Search native SQL operations from your development environment to combine similarity with relational searches.

  * [Perform Exact Similarity Search](perform-exact-similarity-search.md)  
A similarity search looks for the relative order of vectors compared to a query vector. Naturally, the comparison is done using a particular distance metric but what is important is the result set of your top closest vectors, not the distance between them. 
  * [Perform Approximate Similarity Search Using Vector Indexes](perform-approximate-similarity-search-using-vector-indexes.md)  
For a vector search to be useful, it needs to be fast and accurate. Approximate similarity searches seek a balance between these goals. 
  * [Perform Multi-Vector Similarity Search](perform-multi-vector-similarity-search.md)  
Another major use-case of vector search is multi-vector search. Multi-vector search is typically associated with a multi-document search, where documents are split into chunks that are individually embedded into vectors. 
  * [Perform Hybrid Search](perform-hybrid-search.md)  
Hybrid search is an advanced information retrieval technique that lets you search documents by *keywords* and *vectors*, to achieve more relevant search results.
