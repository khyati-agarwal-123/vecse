Use these examples to understand how to create HNSW indexes for vector approximate similarity searches. 
  * [Understand Transaction Support for Tables with HNSW Indexes](understand-transaction-support-tables-hnsw-indexes.md)  
Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) index graphs are static memory-only structures. Transaction maintenance on tables with HNSW indexes is done by using two main structures: private journal and shared journal.
