## Vector Generation Examples {#GUID-843E4921-A390-41F8-8ED0-91D7B67007B6}

Run these end-to-end examples to see how you can generate vector embeddings, both within and outside the database.

  * [Generate Embeddings](generate-embeddings.md)  
In these examples, you can see how to use the `VECTOR_EMBEDDING` SQL function or the `UTL_TO_EMBEDDING` PL/SQL function to generate a vector embedding from input text strings and images. 
  * [Perform Chunking With Embedding](perform-chunking-embedding.md)  
In these examples, you can see how to explore the `VECTOR_CHUNKS` SQL function along with chainable utility PL/SQL functions to split large textual extracts and documents into chunks and then represent each chunk as a vector embedding. 
  * [Configure Chunking Parameters](configure-chunking-parameters.md)  
Oracle AI Vector Search provides many parameters for chunking text data, such as `SPLIT [BY]`, `OVERLAP`, or `NORMALIZE`. In these examples, you can see how to configure these parameters to define your own chunking specifications and strategies, so that you can create meaningful chunks.
