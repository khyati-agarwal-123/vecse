## 9Work with LLM-Powered APIs and Retrieval Augmented Generation {#GUID-AF82CA2B-5B40-4B05-AD1E-E990A4C1BF86}

You can use Vector Utility PL/SQL APIs for prompting Large Language Models (LLMs) with textual prompts and images, using LLM-powered interfaces. You can also communicate with LLMs through the implementation of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), which helps to generate more accurate and informative responses.

  * [Use LLM-Powered APIs to Generate Summary and Text](use-llm-powered-apis-generate-summary-and-text.md)  
Run these end-to-end examples to see how you can summarize or describe textual inputs and images. 
  * [Use Retrieval Augmented Generation to Complement LLMs](use-retrieval-augmented-generation-complement-llms.md)  
RAG lets you mitigate the inaccuracies and hallucinations faced when using LLMs. Oracle AI Vector Search enables RAG within Oracle Database using the `DBMS_VECTOR_CHAIN` PL/SQL package or through popular frameworks (such as LangChain).
