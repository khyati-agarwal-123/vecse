## Describe Image Content {#GUID-05084961-E744-43DE-A4BC-8375EE3444E6}

In these examples, you can see how to generate a textual analysis or description of the contents of a given image.

Here, you supply an image along with a text question as the prompt (for example, "`What is this image about?`" or "`How many birds are there in this image?`"). The LLM responds with a textual answer or description based on the specified task in the prompt, which can then be used for image classification, object detection, or similarity search.
