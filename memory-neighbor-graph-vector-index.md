## In-Memory Neighbor Graph Vector Index {#GUID-59D7DCA9-E63D-46EF-B0D5-F14739DAE53D}

Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) is the only type of In-Memory Neighbor Graph vector index supported. HNSW graphs are very efficient indexes for vector approximate similarity search. HNSW graphs are structured using principles from small world networks along with layered hierarchical organization.
