The default type of index created for a Neighbor Partition vector index is Inverted File Flat. 

  * [Understand Inverted File Flat Vector Indexes](understand-inverted-file-flat-vector-indexes.md)  
The Inverted File Flat vector index is a technique designed to enhance search efficiency by narrowing the search area through the use of neighbor partitions or clusters. 
  * [Inverted File Flat Vector Indexes Partitioning Schemes](inverted-file-flat-vector-indexes-partitioning-schemes.md)  
Inverted File Flat vector indexes support both global and local indexes on partitioned tables. By default, IVF indexes are globally partitioned by centroid.
