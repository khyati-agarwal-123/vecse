## 12Vector Search PL/SQL Packages {#GUID-04ACF179-957C-4F03-AC1D-4DA44B3E12A2}

The `DBMS_VECTOR`, `DBMS_VECTOR_CHAIN`, and `DBMS_HYBRID_VECTOR` PL/SQL APIs are available to support Oracle AI Vector Search capabilities. 

  * [DBMS_VECTOR](dbms_vector-vecse.md)  
The `DBMS_VECTOR` package simplifies common operations with Oracle AI Vector Search, such as extracting chunks or embeddings from user data, generating text for a given prompt or an image, creating a vector index, or reporting on index accuracy. 
  * [DBMS_VECTOR_CHAIN](dbms_vector_chain-vecse.md)  
The `DBMS_VECTOR_CHAIN` package enables advanced operations with Oracle AI Vector Search, such as chunking and embedding data along with text generation and summarization capabilities. It is more suitable for text processing with similarity search and hybrid search, using functionality that can be pipelined together for an end-to-end search. 
  * [DBMS_HYBRID_VECTOR](dbms_hybrid_vector-vecse.md)  
The `DBMS_HYBRID_VECTOR` package contains a JSON-based query API `SEARCH`, which lets you query against hybrid vector indexes.
